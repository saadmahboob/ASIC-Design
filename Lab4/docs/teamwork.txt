2.We worked on our own codes, but for RTL and state diagram, we compared each other's result to make sure it's right. Then, after coding, we debuggd each other's codes to pass all testcases.

3. 2 times, before the meeting, we texted each other for detail meeting time.

4. I drawed the rtl and state diagrams and verified with yudi, did my own coding, and debugged his errors.

5. He had a detail understanding of the test bench, and he fixed all my errors. 

6. I didn't use testbench on Piazza.
